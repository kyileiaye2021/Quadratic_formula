# Quadratic_formula
##### Kyi Lei Aye

### Overview
This program outputs the number of solutions of quadratic equations.

### Problem Analysis
1. Discriminant is part of the quadratic formula that determines the amount of solution.
2. If the discriminant is greater than 0, then there will be two real solutions.
3. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then one real solution will be the output.
4. If the discriminant is less than 0, then there will be two complex solutions.

### Implementation Phase
1. Use include and using directives for input, output, and variables.
2. Declare function with formal parameters
3. Declare main function and taking input values
4. Define function called discriminant to calculate the number of solution
5. Call function in main part of the program
